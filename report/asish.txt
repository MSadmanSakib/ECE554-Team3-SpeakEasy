03/14 - 03/18

	RISC-V Toolchain Setup:
	- Set up the RISC-V GNU Toolchain on my local machine.
	- Successfully cross-compiled a simple "Hello, RISC-V!" program and ran it on QEMU to verify the toolchain.
	
	Testing the Vosk model:
	- Successfully implemented real-time speech recognition using the Vosk model on native Windows.
	- Used Python libraries like sounddevice and vosk to capture audio from the microphone and transcribe it in real-time (testing the Vosk model, which works but not highly accurate).
	- Tested the implementation with multiple audio inputs and verified its accuracy.
	- Identified that WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) does not support direct access to audio devices, which prevented real-time speech recognition in the Ubuntu environment.
	- Explored workarounds, including using Windows for audio capture and passing data to WSL2, but decided to focus on native RISC-V deployment for the next steps.
	
	Next steps:
	- Finalize the C/C++ implementation of the Vosk model for real-time speech recognition.
	- Cross-compile the Vosk API and Kaldi library for RISC-V, or possibly explore other options depending on team's feedback.
	- I want to be able to run the Vosk model using the riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc (toolchain) compiler in real-time.
